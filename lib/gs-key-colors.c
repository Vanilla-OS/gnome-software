/* Extract the key colors from @pb by clustering the pixels in RGB space.
 * Clustering is done using k-means, with initialisation using a
 * Random Partition.
 *
 * This approach can be thought of as plotting every pixel in @pb in a
 * three-dimensional color space, with red, green and blue axes (alpha is
 * clipped to 0 (pixel is ignored) or 1 (pixel is used)). The key colors for
 * the image are the ones where a large number of pixels are plotted in a group
 * in the color space — either a lot of pixels with an identical color
 * (repeated use of exactly the same color in the image) or a lot of pixels in
 * a rough group (use of a lot of similar shades of the same color in the
 * image).
 *
 * By transforming to a color space, information about the X and Y positions of
 * each color is ignored, so a thin outline in the image of a single color
 * will appear in the color space as a cluster, just as a contiguous block of
 * one color would.
 *
 * The k-means clustering algorithm is then used to find these clusters. k-means
 * is used, rather than (say) principal component analysis, because it
 * inherently calculates the centroid for each cluster. In a color space, the
 * centroid is itself a color, which can then be used as the key color to
 * return.
 *
 * The number of clusters is limited to @n_clusters, as a subjective survey of
 * 1000 icons found that they commonly used this number of key colors.
 *
 * Various other shortcuts have been taken which make this approach quite
 * specific to key color extraction from icons, with the aim of making it
 * faster. That’s fine — it doesn’t matter if the results this function produces
 * are optimal, only that they’re good enough. */
