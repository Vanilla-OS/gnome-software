  <h1>Policy</h1>
  <p>
    GNOME Software can optionally use a ratings and reviews service offered by
    your distribution.
    If enabled, GNOME Software will notify a web service that a specific
    application has been installed or removed.
    This information about which software you use helps us provide other users
    with more accurate recommendations and helps us to choose applications to
    feature on the overview page.
  </p>
  <p>
    When submitting ratings your IP address is sent along with the usage information.
    This is exactly the same information submitted viewing this web page.
    A one-way hash of this address is also stored in a database to prevent
    duplicate entries being added by the same user, but this can not be used to
    identify specific users or network addresses.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will never share the list of applications or your IP address with third
    parties other than the original distribution web-service used by GNOME Software.
